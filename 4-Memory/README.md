Note:
All files contain a parameter called `estimate_avg` which can be set to `True` or `False`. When `False`, we will run the process one single time, and will produce verbose output on the screen as we do. When set to `True`, we will run the process 1000 times, and will only give the iteration progress as the output, along with the final value of average success score over all iterations.
